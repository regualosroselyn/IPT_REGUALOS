<p>
One of the biggest achievements I received when I was a senior in high school,
  because I had an award to be with honors and this is one of the biggest thanks 
  I have to myself because of perseverance and hard work.

<div id="info1">

    <p> This is the first award I received in the 2nd year 1st semester, 
      I became a dean lister because of my hard work and perseverance 
      maybe there were many trials but I fought for my goal to graduate.
      As a dean lister, I was under pressure because grades must be maintained.
    </p>

    </div>
   <div id="info2">

       <p>This is the latest that I have achieved, I am very happy and 
         I was able to join the deans lister again even though the other 
         grades were a bit lopsided,but I was able to do it and I will be 
         able to do it for my future.
